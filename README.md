Poisson Distribution, etc

when calling poissonGen, use these parameters (in this order):

averageArrivalRate   :   poisson distribution lamda for arrivals
averageStay          :   poisson distribution lamda for stay length
averageChargeNeed    :   TBD, set as 1 for now
timestep             :   a chunk of time, many within one interval
interval             :   the length of time observed
